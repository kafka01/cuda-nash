Finding Nash equilibria for large games is a computationally difficult task. The goal of this project is to implement a simple algorithm that is well suited to being run in parallel on simple hardware. The algorithm boils down solving a large system of differential equations until they converge within a given tolerance. We believe that the computational architecture of graphics cards is especially well suited to this type of problem.
